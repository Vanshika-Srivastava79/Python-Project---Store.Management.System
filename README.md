# Python-Project---Store.Management.System
The Store Management System is a Python-based application integrated with a MySQL database, designed to simulate the operations of a stationery shop. The system supports role-based access, allowing users to log in as a manager, employee, or customer. Managers can register staff members and assign them unique user IDs, which employees use to log in and manage the product inventory. Customers can view available stock, select products, and receive a detailed bill with the total amount after checkout. This project provides a simple yet effective way to manage store operations through a command-line interface.
